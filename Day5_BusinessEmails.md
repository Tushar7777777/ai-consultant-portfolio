Prompt 1: Executive Summary Email (CFO/Manager level)

Scenario: You have sales data for Jan–Mar.

Jan: 100 units

Feb: 120 units

Mar: 90 units

Prompt:

You are a Business Analyst. Write a professional email to the CFO summarizing sales performance for Jan–Mar 2024. Highlight growth, decline, key reasons, and include one actionable recommendation.

Output:

Subject: Q1 2024 Sales Performance Summary

Dear [CFO’s Name],

I am writing to share a summary of sales performance for January–March 2024:

January: 100 units

February: 120 units (+20% vs. Jan, driven by seasonal demand and promotions)

March: 90 units (–25% vs. Feb, impacted by demand fluctuations and competitor activity)

Key Insight: Sales momentum peaked mid-quarter but declined sharply in March, indicating volatility in customer demand and exposure to competitive pressure.

Recommendation: To reduce this volatility, I recommend a targeted retention and upselling campaign for February customers, with measurable KPIs (repeat purchase rate, upsell conversion). This will help sustain growth in Q2.

Please let me know if you’d like a regional or product-level breakdown to support planning discussions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Business Analyst
